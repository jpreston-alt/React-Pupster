## Pupster

## Description
Pupster is a React application built using create-react-app and the Dog CEO API. From the Discover page, the user is presented with a photo of a dog. If they like the dog they thumbs up the photo, if they don't like it they thumbs down. Then they are presented with a new photo. If the dog likes you back, you've made a friend! The application keeps track of likes and friends made. You can also head the the Search page to search for a breed of dog. Then you are presented with all the photos of that type of dog found in the Dog CEO API.

This was my first attempt at building a React application from scratch and I learned alot about working with components, routing, managing state, and handling events.
